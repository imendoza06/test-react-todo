This simple todo list app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.

npm install
npm start
```

## Funcionalities

### No todos

When there are no todos, the todos list section is hidden.

### New todo

New todos are entered in the input at the top of the app.

### Item

A todo item has these interactions:

* Clicking the checkbox marks the todo as complete.
* Remove button to delete to-do.

### Counter

Displays the number of active todos in a pluralized form: `0 items`, `1 item`, `2 items`. Example: **2** items left

## Future Implementations

- Mark all as complete
- Editing to-do
- Clear ALL completed 
- Pesistence
- Routing - All / Active / Completed
